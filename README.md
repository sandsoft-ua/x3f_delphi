# x3f_delphi
X3F translation to Delphi

Foveon is a great sensor but Sigma Photo Pro software is slow, unstable and misses a few necessary functions.
There is a project Kalpanika (https://github.com/Kalpanika) but it works wrong with my DP2 and SD1 Merrill x3f files.

Goals of current project are:
1) translate all necessary files from project Kalpanika to Delphi (XE5 and above) to create DNG (Digital NeGative) files from Sigma RAW (X3F) files;
2) debug and modify sources for correct work with Sigma DP2 and SD1 Merrill files;
3) add GUI (maybe cross-platform using FMX Library);
4) in future, add image processing functions.

If you find this project useful or just interesting then you can donate any amount for future work.
